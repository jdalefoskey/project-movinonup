# Movin'-On-Up
The app has the essential information needed when considering which city to relocate your growing family to. Housing information, schools and weather forecasts. We’ve partnered with the best and most accurate third party API’s to ensure you get up to date information on any city in the united states.  

<h3>Description</h3> 
We wanted to develop something practical that many people can relate to, and include data that would be pertinent to the user.
User story - The app is meant for the person, or family with a child or children who is looking to relocate to a new city. We know that one of the most important considerations within families living situations is not just the cost of their homes but access to preferred schools. 
<br>
<h3>Technologies used</h3>
•Weather API, 
•Google Maps API, 
•ATTOM API
<br>

<h3>Breakdown of tasks and roles</h3>
Together we brainstormed about familiar api’s and or things we think many people could relate to
Dale created the initial framework using “which program”
Aaron researched weather API and coded the integration into the software
Dale researched the Google Maps and ATTOM API’s and coded the integration into the software
Matt built most of the html framework and implemented css
<br>
•Challenges
Initially we wanted to include median income or cost of living data but the api’s were either expensive or difficult to extrapolate data from. We also began attempting to include historical weather data. 
•Successes - we would be remiss if we didn't comment on the collaboration between partners. Despite not having much direction initially on branching and merging we managed to build on each other’s work and complete a successful application. Due to the aforementioned challenges, several pivots took place during development. /using the agile methodology we were able to not waste much time nor effort before realizing a new direction was needed.

<h3>Directions for Future Development</h3>
As we mentioned earlier, we would like to incorporate cost of living data and weather to the app. Our team will continue to research available API’s to partner with that will allow this software to be even more powerful.
